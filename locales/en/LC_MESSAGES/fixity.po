"Checking fixity is the process of ensuring that digital files have not "
"changed unexpectedly over time. The Archivematica Storage Service exposes"
" an API endpoint that enables users to check the fixity of individual "
"AIPs in storage. Users can access the API endpoint directly or by using "
"the Fixity application developed by Artefactual."

"Archivematica AIPs are packaged according to the `BagIt File Packaging "
"Format`_. The fixity API endpoint verifies the bag by validating the "
"contents of the bag against the checksums and payload oxum listed in the "
"bag files. This can tell users if files have been modified, deleted, or "
"added to the AIP."
